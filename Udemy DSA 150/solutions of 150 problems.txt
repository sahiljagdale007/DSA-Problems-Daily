1.Maximum Subarray
Easy

Given an integer array nums, find the subarray with the largest sum, and return its sum.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: The subarray [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum 6.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1
Explanation: The subarray [1] has the largest sum 1.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [5,4,-1,7,8]
Output: 23
Explanation: The subarray [5,4,-1,7,8] has the largest sum 23.
 
Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 105
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
 
Follow up: If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.

Solution:
class Solution {
    public int maxSubArray(int[] nums) {
        int max = nums[0];
        int currSum = nums[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) { // 1 to (n-1)
            if (currSum < 0) {
                currSum = 0;
            }
            currSum = currSum + nums[i];
            if (currSum > max) {
                max = currSum;
            }
        }
        return max;
    }
}

2.Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
Easy

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.
Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

Example 1:

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
Example 2:

Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.

Constraints:
1 <= prices.length <= 105
0 <= prices[i] <= 104

Solution:
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int n = prices.length;
        int buyPrice = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int maxProfit = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (buyPrice < prices[i]) {
                int profit = prices[i] - buyPrice;
                maxProfit = Math.max(maxProfit, profit);
            } else {
                buyPrice = prices[i];
            }
        }
        return maxProfit;
    }
}

3.Maximum Product Subarray
Medium

Given an integer array nums, find a subarray that has the largest product, and return the product.
The test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,3,-2,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: [2,3] has the largest product 6.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [-2,0,-1]
Output: 0
Explanation: The result cannot be 2, because [-2,-1] is not a subarray.

Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104
-10 <= nums[i] <= 10

The product of any subarray of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

Solution:
class Solution {
    public int maxProduct(int[] nums) {
        if (nums == null || nums.length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        int maxProduct = nums[0];
        int minProduct = nums[0];

        int result = nums[0];

        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] >= 0) {
                maxProduct = Math.max(nums[i], maxProduct * nums[i]);
                minProduct = Math.min(nums[i], minProduct * nums[i]);
            } else {
                int temp = maxProduct;
                maxProduct = Math.max(nums[i], minProduct * nums[i]);
                minProduct = Math.min(nums[i], temp * nums[i]);
            }
            result = Math.max(result, maxProduct);
        }
        return result;
    }
}

4. Product of Array Except Self
Medium

Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].
The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]
Output: [0,0,9,0,0]

Constraints:
2 <= nums.length <= 105
-30 <= nums[i] <= 30
The input is generated such that answer[i] is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

Follow up: Can you solve the problem in O(1) extra space complexity? (The output array does not count as extra space for space complexity analysis.)

Solution:
class Solution {
    public int[] productExceptSelf(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;

        int right[] = new int[n];
        int left[] = new int[n];

        int output[] = new int[n];

        left[0] = 1;
        right[n - 1] = 1;

        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            left[i] = left[i - 1] * nums[i - 1];
        }

        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            right[i] = right[i + 1] * nums[i + 1];
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            output[i] = left[i] * right[i];
        }
        return output;
    }
}

5.Rotate Array
Medium

Given an integer array nums, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]

Example 2:
Input: nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2
Output: [3,99,-1,-100]
Explanation: 
rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]

Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 105
-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
0 <= k <= 105
 
Follow up:

Try to come up with as many solutions as you can. There are at least three different ways to solve this problem.
Could you do it in-place with O(1) extra space?

Solution:
class Solution {
    public void rotate(int[] nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.length;
        k = k % n;
        reverse(nums, 0, n - 1);
        reverse(nums, 0, k - 1);
        reverse(nums, k, n-1);
    }

    // helper function
    void reverse(int arr[], int start, int end) {
        int i = start;
        int j = end;

        while (i < j) {
            int temp = arr[i];
            arr[i] = arr[j];
            arr[j] = temp;
            i++;
            j--;
        }
    }
}


6. Max Consecutive Ones
Easy
Given a binary array nums, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,1,0,1,1,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s. The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,0,1,1,0,1]
Output: 2

Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 105
nums[i] is either 0 or 1

Solution:

class Solution {
    public int findMaxConsecutiveOnes(int[] nums) {
        int ans = 0;
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] == 0) {
                count = 0;
            } else {
                count++;
            }
            if (count > ans) {
                ans = count;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
